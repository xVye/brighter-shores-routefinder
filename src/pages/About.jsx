        Select bounties which you currently have, and the tool will use{" "}
        <ExternalLink to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">
          Dijkstra&apos;s algorithm
        </ExternalLink>{" "}
        to find the best possible paths for you to take to complete each bounty.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Rooms unlocked by quests and den raids are taken into account, so make
        sure to <InternalLink to="/configuration">configure</InternalLink> your
        settings accordingly.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        You can optionally wait and select more bounties when they become
        available from the bounty board. The tool will calculate the best route
        from all possible bounties and let you know which ones to abandon and
        which ones to pick up.
      </Paragraph>

      <Subheading>Time estimations</Subheading>

      <Paragraph>
        The best routes are calculated by time and not by distance. ETAs are
        provided for each step of the route and are a great way to gauge the
        accuracy of the tool. If you find these estimations are off, then please
        let us know on our{" "}
        <ExternalLink to="https://discord.gg/fcSYv9GPwJ">

        so that we can improve our algorithm.
