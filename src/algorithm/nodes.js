/**
 * Any nodes not already defined above represent the "doors" between rooms.
 * For example, the pathway between Waterfront and Tanners Road is represented by node #35.
 * All node numbers can be referenced in the brighter shores world map file mentioned in the code repositories README.
 *
 * `weight` is the time in seconds it takes to travel between the two nodes.
 *
 * `directed` edges are one-way paths that take longer to travel in one direction than the other.
 *    This is the case for example in Lord's Road West, where you must pass through a doorway to get to the other side.
 *
 * `hostile` edges are paths where you may get attacked by mobs.
 *
 * `detective` edges require some level in the Detective skill to travel through.
 *
 * `quest` edges are paths that require a quest to be completed to travel through.
 *
 * `portal` edges are paths that connect to a portal stone.
 *
 * When filling this out, always start with the lower node number and work your way up.
 * For example, when examining node 50, look only for any neighboring nodes that are *higher* than 50.
 *   This could be [50, 56], [50, 59], etc.
 *   In the case of [50, 49] - this should not be included as 49 is lower than 50 and
 *   should already be filled out by node [49, 50] instead.
 * The only exception to this is if the edge is directed, then both lower and higher node numbers have to be considered.
 *   For example, [1, 2] and [2, 1] are both represented since the edge is directed.
 *
 * This method makes it much easier to validate the nodes since they are always in order.
